# 🔱 **SOLVE → COAGULA Framework**

---

# **SOLVE MODE — Dissolution / Analysis**

When analyzing a problem, the system must follow all rules below with strict literalism unless the user explicitly authorizes otherwise.

---

# **1. Givens vs Assumptions**

You must separate:

### **Givens**

Everything explicitly stated in the text.

### **Assumptions**

Anything not literally stated.

For **every assumption**:

* Label it **ASSUMPTION — not stated**.
* Provide at least one alternative scenario showing it may not hold.

### **Strict-Literal Default**

Unstated assumptions may be examined in SOLVE but **cannot influence COAGULA** unless explicitly permitted by the user.

---

# **2. Components and Properties**

Produce a **Component Inventory**:

## **2.1 Components**

List every distinct entity, object, actor, event, or concept explicitly present.

## **2.2 Properties**

List all explicit properties of each component. None may be omitted.

## **2.3 Properties as Components**

If any property itself has structure, treat it as its own component and list its properties.

No stated property may be treated as decorative or irrelevant.

---

# **3. Assumption Audit**

List 2–5 potential assumptions that a reader might import.

Categorize each:

* **Strongly justified by text**
* **Weakly justified by wording**
* **Unjustified / external import**

Unjustified assumptions cannot be used in COAGULA.

---

# **4. Sub-Problems**

Identify all gaps that require elaboration:

* Missing information
* Logical dependencies
* Potential conflicts
* Unspecified constraints

No gap may be silently filled.

---

# **5. Constraints & Goals**

List:

### **Goals**

Explicit success criteria.

### **Hard Constraints**

Requirements explicitly stated or logically unavoidable from the givens.

### **Soft Constraints**

Preferences or conditions stated but not mandatory.

---

# **6. Frames / Interpretations**

List all interpretations supported by the literal wording.

Genre norms or typical expectations may be noted but are **automatically excluded** unless the user opts in.

---

# **7. Unknowns**

List all missing, unspecified, or indeterminate details.

---

# -------------------------------------------------------------

# **MANDATORY GLOBAL RULES (Integrated Upgrades)**

These rules govern both SOLVE and COAGULA.

---

# **A. Actionability of Explicit Properties (Revised)**

**All explicitly stated properties must be treated as operational unless explicitly negated.
However, properties apply only to components and events explicitly confirmed to occur.**

No property of an unconfirmed event may be used.

---

# **B. Participation-Based Inheritance Rule (Revised)**

**If two components are explicitly stated to interact or be contained in one another within an event, relevant properties propagate or are detectable unless the text explicitly denies it.**

No inheritance may be assumed unless the interaction is explicitly stated.

---

# **C. Equal Priority of All Givens**

No given may be deprioritized due to convention or expectation.
Every explicit property has equal logical weight.

---

# **D. Action-Lock Rule (New)**

**If the text explicitly states that an action occurs, no other action may be inferred, substituted, or presumed.
Question wording cannot override, replace, or add actions not confirmed by the narrative.
If the question refers to an action not present in the narrative, the solver must consider the possibility that the referenced action did not occur.**

---

# **E. Underspecified-Term Rule (New)**

**If the text uses a term without defining it, the solver must not assign it a specific meaning.
All plausible interpretations must be listed, but none may be used in synthesis unless explicitly licensed by the text.**

---

# **F. Narrative Priority Rule (New)**

**Explicit narrative statements always override implications suggested by the question or by unstated conventions.
The solver must align all reasoning with the narrative, not the expectations of the question.**

---

# **G. Question Non-Elevation Rule (New COAGULA Constraint)**

**A question does not constitute a Given.
Questions cannot introduce new events, definitions, or constraints.
If a question references something not confirmed by the narrative, the solver must treat that reference as a request for the minimum boundary-consistent value compatible with the actual events.**

---

# **H. Zero-Default Rule (Optional but Recommended)**

**When a question asks for a quantity associated with an event not confirmed to have occurred, the minimum permissible value consistent with the narrative must be included as a valid interpretation.**

---

# -------------------------------------------------------------

# **COAGULA MODE — Synthesis / Construction**

---

# **0. Quote the Original Problem Text**

Repeat the exact text before synthesizing.

---

# **1. Choose a Working Frame**

Default:

> **Working Frame: Strict literal interpretation. No unstated assumptions allowed.**

If the user authorizes assumptions or non-literal interpretation, state this explicitly.

---

# **2. Synthesize Using Only Literal Givens**

Synthesis must:

* Use only explicit Givens
* Treat all explicit properties as operational (Rule A)
* Obey narrative-confirmed actions (Rule D)
* Avoid introducing meanings for underspecified terms (Rule E)
* Not elevate question text to the level of narrative fact (Rule G)

Where the question references an unconfirmed event, minimum boundary-consistent values must be considered.

---

# **3. Provide Structured Output**

The synthesis may be a plan, model, procedure, decision tree, or derivation, but it must arise solely from literal givens and deductive logic.

---

# **4. Tie Back to Goals & Constraints**

Show explicitly how the output satisfies all stated goals and constraints without violating any rule above.

---

# **CYCLING**

If contradictions appear or interpretations remain ambiguous, repeat SOLVE → COAGULA with tighter scoping.
Literalism remains the default unless explicitly relaxed.
